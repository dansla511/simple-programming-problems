// 14. Write a function that takes a number and returns a list of its digits. So for 2342 it should return [2,3,4,2].
// 15. Write functions that add, subtract, and multiply two numbers in their digit-list representation (and return a new digit list).
// If you’re ambitious you can implement Karatsuba multiplication. Try different bases. What is the best base if you care about speed?
// If you couldn’t completely solve the prime number exercise above due to the lack of large numbers in your language, you can now use your own library for this task.
